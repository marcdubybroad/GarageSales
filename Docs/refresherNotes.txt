Notes:


- min sdk is pretty much 15 from now on, 4.0

- adb commands
  - adb shell
  - add uninstall com.garagesalesapp
  - adb install app-debug.apk
  
- gradle
  - gradle.settings
    - include ':app'        -> includes module app, which is the main application; think of app as a module
  - .gradle/wrapper         -> has a gradle.jar with the version used to compile; .properties file specifies version
  
- apk manager
  - if want google mobile services, need to install google API
  - same with tv and wear
  
- libraries
  - in garagze-library/build.gradle
    -   apply plugin: 'android-library'         -> specifies that this is a library, cannot be run as a standalone app
    
    
- android studio
  - anytime you see something in grey, it is something that doesn't really exist but is translated by the IDE for you
    - ex: and R.id.* value
    
- Refresher erratta
  - need to add following to app/build.gradle
    -     compile project(':garagze-library')
