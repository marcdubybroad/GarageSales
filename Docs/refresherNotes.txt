Notes:


- min sdk is pretty much 15 from now on, 4.0

- adb commands
  - adb shell
  - add uninstall com.garagesalesapp
  - adb install app-debug.apk
  
- gradle
  - gradle.settings
    - include ':app'        -> includes module app, which is the main application; think of app as a module
  - .gradle/wrapper         -> has a gradle.jar with the version used to compile; .properties file specifies version
  - in gradle.properties
    - org.gradle.parallel=true   -> can compile multiple modules at the same time
    - org.gradle.daemon=true     -> keeps the jvm up at all times, mkes serial builds faster through the development day
  - with existing projects, upgrade to gradle 2.2.4
    - go into gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties, change the distributionUrl to the wanted version
      - big performance improvement from 2.2.1 to 2.4
      - gradle-2.4-all.zip
  - anything you can do with a button can do from command line; equivalent process, which is why they switched to gradle
  

ToDo:
  - sned email after conference to get new version w/o typos
  
- Unit testing
  - androidTest directory is where they should go; will not be included in apk
  - use same pcakged structure for visibility
  - running as android test, deploys build/outputs/apk/app-debug-androidTest-unaligned.apk
  - can get visual list on left
    - right click on test, can get statistics
  - @UiThreadTest  -> can only change a UI element off of the UI thread (tests run on a seperate thread)
  - Espresso testing   -> framework recomemnded to do UI testing on Android
  
    
      
- apk manager
  - if want google mobile services, need to install google API
  - same with tv and wear
  
- libraries
  - in garagze-library/build.gradle
    -   apply plugin: 'android-library'         -> specifies that this is a library, cannot be run as a standalone app
    
    
- android studio
  - anytime you see something in grey, it is something that doesn't really exist but is translated by the IDE for you
    - ex: and R.id.* value
    
- Refresher erratta
  - need to add following to app/build.gradle
    -     compile project(':garagze-library')

- emulators
  - genymotion emulators, good and robust, free versions
    - does not support google mobile services
    - runs on virtualBox
    
    
- sayings
  - functionality before performance
  - how long should a man's legs be? Long enough to reach the ground (Abraham Lincoln)
  
    
- tips
  - go to Canary channel Android Studio a week after new release; usually bugs already fixed by then
  - state farm has 2x testing code than production code; at the functional extreme
  
- terminal mode
  - gradle commands that can be run
    -ex: gradlew :app:generatedDebugSources
